# Git and Github :

Git is a version control system - meaning (this tool helps is tracking the chages in the code)

git is popular , fast , open source , free and scalable

**repository :** project present in the github 

**directory :** file present in the vscode

# **Features :** 

1. tracks the history
2. to collaborate with the team

Github : it is a website , used to  store and manage the code using git 

official website : https://github.com

**Configuring Git :** 

1. git config --global user.name "meghana3M"
2. git config --global user.email "meghanachowtala@gmail.com"
3. git config --list : to check what are the configurations that we have setup
4. git --version : to check the version of git

**Basic commands of Git :**

local => our laptop / pc

remote => github
* **clone and status**
* 1. git clone <  link of https   > : this command is used to  clone the files present in github to vscode
  2. git status : to know the status of the file , what are the files present which data is deleted etc..... , displays the status of the code
  3. ls : list of items present in the folder
  4. ls -a : all the items present in the folder including the hidden files

* **add ----> commit**
  **git status :**
  1. untracked :  new files that git did not track
  2. modified : changed
  3. staged : file is ready to be commited ===> add
  4. unmodified : unchanged ===> commit
* **Add and commit :**
  1. git add <  filename  > ---> add new file or changed file
  2. git commit -m "message" ----> git is the record of change
* **Push command** : git push origin main ===> used to push the code from local to remote
* **Init command :**
  1. init - used to create a  new git repo
  2. git init
  3. git remote add origin main < link  >
  4. git remote -v (to verify the remote)
  5. git branch (to verify the branch)
  6. git branch -M main  (to change the branch)
  7. git push origin main
* **Branch commands :**
  1.git branch (to check the branch)
  2. git branch -M main (to rename the branch)
  3. git checkout < branch name > (to navigate)
  4.git checkout -b branch (to create new branch)
  5. git branch -d < branch name  >   (to delete branch)
* **Merging the clone :**
  1. git diff < branch name >   (to compare commit , branches , files and more )
  2. git merge < branch name > (to merge 2 branches)
  3. create PR ===> pull request (it lets you tell others about changes you have pushed to the branch in a repo on github) pull command is used to fetch and download content from remote repo and immediately update local repo to match that content
* **Resolving Merge conflicts :** event that takes place when git is unstable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits
* **undoing changes :**
  1. case 1 : staged changes  ==> git reset <  filename  >
  2. case 2 : commited changes(for one commit) ===>  git reset HEAD~1
  3. case 3 : commited changes (for many commits) ====>  git reset <  commit hash  >git reseet --hard < commit hash >

* **Fork :** new repo that shares code and visibility settings with original ""upstream "" repo , fork is a rough copy .
